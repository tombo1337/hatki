## What this project does

This Project is intented to gives old Devices such as a Amazon Kindle a new life by enabeling them to represent Homeassistant enteties. 

This project contains template HTML files. These files are read by the python
script. The python script requests data from Home Assistant and uses that data
to fill in the placeholders in the template HTML files. The resulting HTML files
can be opened by the Kindle web browser.
